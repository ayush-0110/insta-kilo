# Insta-Kilo-Gram

## Description

Insta-Kilo-Gram is a React project that mimics the functionality of Instagram. It's an excellent platform for users who want to share their photos and experiences, like others' posts, and engage with their community. Insta-Kilo-Gram utilizes Swiperjs to provide a sleek, modern interface similar to Instagram.

One of the unique features of Insta-Kilo-Gram is the use of Suprsend, a service that sends both SMS and email notifications. Whenever a user likes a post, Suprsend sends a notification to the admin, the user who liked the post, and the user whose post was liked. This ensures everyone stays up-to-date with what's happening on the platform.
